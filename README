This is a very simple Backbone app for iOS, based heavily on the example todos app.

Todo:
- add swipe to delete
- remove dependencies and minify (right now loading is slow because of all the external JS)
- try using Zepto (which has swipe support) instead of jQuery (currently raises an exception with a straight swap)
  - closed, but maybe related: https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/issues/55

You will need:
- Backbone.js - http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/
  - The Backbone localStorage example, backbone-localstorage.js
- Underscore - http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/
- json2.js - https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js
