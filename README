This is a very simple Backbone app, based heavily on the example todos app.

You will need:
- Backbone.js - http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/
  - The Backbone localStorage example, backbone-localstorage.js
- Underscore - http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/
- json2.js - https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js
