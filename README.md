This is a very simple HTML5 web app for keeping a tally. Create a tally, tap to add to the count, swipe to delete. You can use it live at: [http://tylorsherman.com/tally/tally.html](http://tylorsherman.com/tally/tally.html)

It was built with iOS and for the best experience add it to your home screen. It uses local storage and application caching and is based heavily on the Backbone example todos app.
